# HospitalRun UX Research
This repo is used to propose and house UX research for HospitalRun.

## How to propose research

UX research can be categorized into 3 categories: 
- Exploratory research - Seeks to define and develop a deeper understanding of the problem space 
- Problem validation - Seeks to provide decision makers with a well-understood, clearly articulated problem or painpoint
- Solution validation - Seeks to assess if the feature/design has solved the problem that it was initially intended to solve.

**Steps in the UX research process**
1. Define goals, objectives, and hypothesis
2. Draft research plan
3. Recruit participants
4. Collect data
5. Analyze and synthesize data
6. Document research findings
7. (Optional) Follow up with the issue that this was initially related to and the owners of that issue to close the loop with research and design recommendations.
